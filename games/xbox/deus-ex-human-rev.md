  title: "DEUS EX: HUMAN REVOLUTION"
  description: "The Games on Demand version supports  English.  In DEUS EX : HUMAN REVOLUTION, you play Adam Jensen, a security specialist, handpicked to oversee the defense of one of America&rsquo;s most experimental biotechnology firms. But when a black ops team uses a plan you designed to break in and kill the scientists you were hired to protect, everything you thought you knew about your job changes. At a time when scientific advancements are routinely turning athletes, soldiers and spies into super-enhanced beings, someone is working very hard to ensure mankind&rsquo;s evolution follows a particular path, and you need to discover why - the decisions you take and the choices you make, will be the only things that can change it.  Featured in more than 50 &ldquo;Best of 2011&rdquo; videogame lists,  Machinima.com- 95/100 &ldquo;absolutely fantastic&rdquo;,  Eurogamer.net- 9/10 &quot;When you finish, you just want to play it again&quot;,  Xbox World Magazine- 9.4/10 &ldquo;It&apos;s a great shooter, a great stealth game, a great RPG&rdquo;,  Edge-online.com&ndash; 9/10 &ldquo;Remarkable and unique&rdquo;,  Official Xbox Magazine- &ldquo;Deliriously addictive&rdquo;,  IGN.com- 9/10,  1UP.com- A."
