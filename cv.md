### Summary
I am a London-based PHP developer with several years’ commercial PHP experience in both **eCommerce** and **CMS** websites. I have a keen interest in data integration (using **APIs** and **WebServices**), and production of  well formatted, readable and, maintainable code and dynamic, effective websites (using open standards, including **CSS3** and **HTML5**).

I was employed as a **CMS** developer at **Senokian Solutions** in Coventry, where I honed my principally self-taught PHP knowledge to build extendible and maintainable object orientated code within an **MVC** environment. I am a quick learner, able to pick up new concepts and ideas quickly and use them effectively. Coupled with my effective communication skills, this ability allows me to succeed in an agile development environment.

Within **Pod1** I worked primarily with the **Magento** eCommerce platform, managing the complexities involved in building **eCommerce** solutions tailored to a client’s specific needs. I have been writing extensions to take advantage of **Magento's** higher functionality. I worked directly with the clients to deliver an accurate and workable specification, so projects can be completed on time, on budget, and on spec, using **WordPress**, **Magento**, **Prototype Javascript**, and **Symfony**.

Currently employed at **Warner Music Group** as a **Strategic Technology Engineer**, which is a fancy name for **Tech Lead** and **Lead Architect** of the **Magento** eCommerce project there. This involves planning the future scoping of the platform, working with the various business owners, and the wider **financial** and **stock management** systems within the company.

I hope to continue building my skills, expanding them to take in a wider scope of environments and languages, and to develop my managerial skills so I can effectively manage a large development team with multiple simultaneous projects.

### Experience
**Strategic Technology Engineer** - [Warner Music Group](http://www.wmg.com/) (London, United Kingdom)  
*November 2011 - Present*  
**Magento Technical Architect** - [Warner Music Group](http://www.wmg.com/) (London, United Kingdom)  
*August 2011 - November 2011*  
Brought on as a lead on the **Magento** project, from both a technical and project management standpoint, I had to assimilate the codebase, quirks, and understand the unique business model employed within the company. The ongoing project is to modernise the code, bringing it all up to best practices to allow for a much easier upgrade process and ongoing maintenance. This also involves implementing a modern **Continuous Integration** and **Automated Testing** system, heavily integrated with [GitHub](https://github.com) **Pull Requests** and issue tracking. The code was developed internally as well as with several 3rd party agencies, requiring advanced usage of **pull requests** and code audits to maintain system integrity.

**Senior Developer** - [Public Creative](http://www.publicreative.com/) (London, United Kingdom)  
*May 2011 - July 2011*  
During my short stay at Public Creative my job was to take the lead of the development department, and act as the main consultant on all projects, working the the development team to develop the best options for the client. The projects were as diverse as **WordPress** blogs, **Drupal** driven timesheet software, and bespoke **API** maintenance for **iPhone** applications. I was also involved in being the technical contact for clients, to explain technical concepts to non-technical personnel.

**Developer** - [Pod1](http://www.pod1.com/) (London, United Kingdom)  
*January 2009 - April 2011*  
Working as one of the core **Magento** developers, working directly on the Pod1 core version, I have had to write efficient and maintainable code that would be rolled out to multiple clients over the course of time. Working with every aspect of **Magento** to produce modules that can be easily and quickly rolled out and modified to better suit the wide range of needs that clients will have. Alongside this I have been the development lead on a number of projects, working with developers in **Cape Town** and **New York**. This has required good communication skills, and the ability to spec projects to the level of detail required to be able to work from with as few issues as possible. This has also involved liaising directly with key members of the clients team or contractors for handover, or for integrating warehouse systems into **Magento**.

**Junior Developer** - Senokian Solutions (Coventry, United Kingdom)  
*June 2007 - December 2008*  
As a developer in a small startup agency I was required to work every angle on a project, from working with the client to deliver an accurate specification, building the **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and Backend functionality, often being the main point of call for the client. I worked on the companies in-house **CRM** systems [EGS](http://www.enterprisegroupwaresystem.org/) and [TactileCRM](http://www.tactilecrm.co.uk/) and through this I learned to work in a team and, more importantly, write scalable and maintainable code.
