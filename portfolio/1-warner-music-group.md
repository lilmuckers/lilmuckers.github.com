    <h3>About <small>This isn't agency work</small></h3>
    
    <p>The <strong>Warner Music Group</strong> Magento instance is quite a big one, and since it's a single large project and I can't really sum this work up in the same way that I have for my other jobs within agencies. So I'll just give a brief overview of my role and throw in some screenshots and links.</p>
