    <h3>Pro Bike Kit <small><a href="http://www.probikekit.com/">http://www.probikekit.com/</a></small></h3>
    <p>Replatform of a large and established brand on the internet to the <strong>Magento eCommerce platform</strong>. I was the lead developer, responsible for all aspects of the backend of the build, concentrating primarily on integration with their warehouse management system, <a href="http://www.sap.com/sme/solutions/businessmanagement/businessone/index.epx"><strong>SAP BusinessOne</strong></a>. The primary challenges being limitation in the Magento API with respect to speed, which required a rethink of indexing and the save process both within Magento, and within BusinessOne. I was required to work closely with the third party supplier and the client themselves to build, test and deliver the backend integration. This was easily the largest Magento implementation I have been responsible for, requiring load balanced servers, <strong>MySQL5 database replication</strong>, and the challenges involved in using these systems. I was also required to work closely with the Magento developers themselves to solve some issues that came to the fore in the build process.</p>
